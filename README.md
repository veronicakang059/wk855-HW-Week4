# wk855-HW-Week4

Keep updating the "Gravity Ball" game this week.
Updating high scores string and list to print out all the high scores in the game ending scene.

But there is a bug said "Object reference not set to instance of an object", which leads to non-change in text in final scene. Tried to fix that by checking components, not working. Will try sooner.
